<h2>Neural Network</h2>
<p>One of the major weaknesses of perceptron is that they are linear! Namely, they are unable to learn arbitrary decision boundaries. One approach solving this is to chain together a collection of perceptrons to build more complex <i>neural networks</i>. An example of a neural network is shown in Figure x Here, you can see 2 inputs (features) that are fed into 4 hidden units. These hidden units are then fed in to 2 output units. Each edge in this figure corresponds to a different weight.</p>
